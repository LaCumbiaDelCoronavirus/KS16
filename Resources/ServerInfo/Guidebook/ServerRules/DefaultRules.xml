# Klovnstation rules

  Klovnstation prides itself on maximising player agency, but there are still some basic rules you have to obey in order for everyone to have fun. However, our bans are either unappealable short cool-off bans or unappealable permabans, so unless you're a child raping pedophile you will most likely never be banned for too long.
  Ignore the remaining rules if there are any left. This is the only rule document.


## CORES RULES

  - Use English, lest you be adminabused.
  - Do not abuse LOOC or OOC, lest you be adminabused.
  - No sexual content. There could be kids here and I am not doing age checks, so if I see anyone ERPing they are getting permad.
  - Metacomming is very gigachad but please do not use them too abusively, such as talking when you are dead and whatnot. Since we lack an option to enforce this, this is basically an appeal to your good will.
  - If you cheat, you are a faggot and you will get banned for a while to cool off or mercilessly raped by the admins.
  - Do not be a weaselly pilpulstein faggot.

## IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES

  - Cyborgs must obey their laws familiars their masters, et cetera. Cool-off ban if not obeyed.
  - Do not fuck with arrivals and do not cause irreparable round ending damage to the station within the first 15 minutes. Cool-off ban if not obeyed.
  - Antags must be friendly to their team and security + command must try to keep the station running for as long as possible. This is due to the power these rules wield and the rarity of an antag drop. Cool-off ban if not obeyed.
  - Try to do your job. This is again a gentlemen's agreement.
  - Keep RP to at least the bare minimum. Do not use internet speak in communication.
  - Borgs' HUD tells them who is crew.

By accepting these rules, you consent to the server redialing you to other servers in our network. (lololol leaving this here but we dont have any lololol)
