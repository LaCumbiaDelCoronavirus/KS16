# Atmosia rules

  Atmosia is an atmos (and other feature) playground hosted as a cooperative effort between Klovnstation 14 and Atmosia Information Agency. As such it is not a server in the traditional sense.


## RULES

  - Do not prematurely end the round or aid in its ending unless a majority of the server agrees.
  - Do not hinder others. This includes things like breaking others' projects, killing others or using the sandbox menu to spawn a singularity. In general, if they tell you to stop, you stop.
  - Do not cause undue lag or performance hits to the server, as it influences others.
  - Do not say slurs in OOC.

By accepting these rules, you consent to the server redialing you to other servers in our network. (lololol leaving this here but we dont have any lololol)
